# Advanced Database Technologies

This repository contains several example code, problems, and sample data that are used in the Advanced Database Technologies LLx course. These examples were written with the MIT Supercloud and Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center (LLSC) in mind, however they may be relevant to other systems.

## Getting the Examples
To run the examples you have a few options:
1. **MIT Supercloud and LLSC Only**: Copy these examples to your home directory from the shared location (ask the Supercloud or LLSC team for the path)
    1. Log into the system (ssh or Jupyter)
    2. If using Jupyter, open a terminal window
    3. Run: `cp -r ~/path/to/shared/examples/advanced-db-tech ~`
1. **Any system with git installed**: Use git clone to clone the repository onto the system where you want to run the examples
    1. In a terminal window, log into the system where you want the examples (on MIT Supercloud you must be on the login node)
    2. Run: `git clone https://github.com/llsc-supercloud/advanced-db-tech.git`
1. **Any system:** Download the repository and transfer:
    1. Click the "Clone and Download" button on the top right
    2. Click "Download Zip"
    3. Transfer the zipped repo to the system you are working on (refer to the documentation for your system for instructions on how to do this)
    4. Log into your system (ssh or Jupyter on MIT Supercloud or LLSC)
    5. Unzip your examples: `unzip advanced-db-tech-master.zip`
